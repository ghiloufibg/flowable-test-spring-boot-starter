# flowable-test-spring-boot-starter

A Docker-free Spring Boot test starter for **any** Flowable BPMN project: embedded DB, embedded
Kafka (topics auto-discovered from Flowable's own Kafka Event Registry `*.channel` files),
declarative HTTP mocking (plain WireMock mapping JSON, convention over configuration), and a
generic process-testing DSL. Built as a Testcontainers-free replacement for full end-to-end BPMN
process tests in CI environments where Docker isn't available.

This is a library, not an application tied to any one BPMN process — every public API operates on
process instance IDs, activity IDs, candidate group names, and plain classpath conventions. See
[`flowable-test-example`](flowable-test-example) for a reference consumer, owned by this repo, that
depends on this starter exactly like an external project would.

## Modules

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `flowable-test-core` | Annotations, `ProcessTestHarness`, `KafkaTestBridge`, HTTP stub types. No auto-configuration. |
| `flowable-test-autoconfigure` | `@AutoConfiguration` classes, `EnvironmentPostProcessor`s, `ContextCustomizerFactory`. Has its own internal test suite (test-scope only) validating every capability against a real, pinned Flowable engine. |
| `flowable-test-spring-boot-starter` | The artifact you actually depend on — a thin aggregator of the two above. |
| `flowable-test-example` | A real Spring Boot + Flowable + Kafka Event Registry order-processing app depending on `flowable-test-spring-boot-starter` (test scope) like any external consumer. Not part of the release artifacts — validates the starter end to end. |

## Getting started

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.flowabletest</groupId>
    <artifactId>flowable-test-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Kafka and HTTP-mocking support are opt-in: add these yourself if you need them (never forced on a
project that doesn't use them):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.wiremock</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-standalone</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace your `@SpringBootTest @ActiveProfiles("test")` stack with one annotation:

```java
@FlowableProcessTest
class OrderProcessTest {

    @Autowired ProcessTestHarness harness;
    @Autowired RuntimeService runtimeService;

    @Test
    void managerApprovalCompletesTheOrder() {
        ProcessInstance pi = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("orderProcessing", vars);

        harness.completeSingleTask(pi.getId(), "managers", Map.of("approved", true));

        harness.assertThat(pi.getId()).hasEndedAt("endEventCompleted");
    }
}
```

## Capabilities

### Embedded database

H2 by default — no configuration needed, this is just Spring Boot's own embedded-database
support. If `io.zonky.test:embedded-postgres` is on your test classpath, it's auto-detected and
replaces H2 automatically (a Docker-free, native-binary alternative for delegates that rely on
Postgres-specific SQL — JSON columns, arrays — that H2's dialect emulation can't cover). No
configuration needed for this either; just add the dependency.

Override the auto-detection with `flowable.test.datasource.provider`:

```yaml
flowable:
  test:
    datasource:
      provider: h2 # force H2 even if embedded-postgres is on the classpath
      # provider: embedded-postgres  # require embedded-postgres explicitly
      # provider: auto               # default: prefer embedded-postgres when present
```

By default, embedded-postgres forks a fresh native process per Spring context (`per-context`).
Opt into a single JVM-wide server shared across contexts — each still gets its own isolated logical
database — with `flowable.test.datasource.embedded-postgres.instance-scope=shared`:

```yaml
flowable:
  test:
    datasource:
      provider: embedded-postgres
      embedded-postgres:
        instance-scope: shared # per-context (default) | shared
```

### Embedded Kafka

If `spring-kafka-test` is on your classpath, topics are discovered automatically by scanning your
project's Flowable Kafka Event Registry `*.channel` descriptors (both the outbound `"topic"` and
inbound `"topics"` shapes) — no `@EmbeddedKafka(topics = {...})` list to hand-maintain.
`@Autowired KafkaTestBridge` gives you `send(topic, key, value)` /
`awaitMessage(topic, predicate, timeout)` without writing raw producer/consumer boilerplate.

By default, the embedded broker is a JVM-wide singleton shared across every Spring context
(`shared`) — a `TestExecutionListener` starts/stops each context's Flowable-managed inbound Kafka
Event Registry consumer container(s) at test class boundaries, so at most one context's consumers
are ever polling at once, even when Spring reuses a JVM across test classes with different
`@MockExternalService` configurations. Opt into a fresh broker per Spring context instead (no
lifecycle choreography needed, at the cost of a broker start per context) with
`flowable.test.kafka.broker-scope=per-context`:

```yaml
flowable:
  test:
    kafka:
      broker-scope: shared # shared (default) | per-context
```

See `claudedocs/kafka-shared-broker-context-isolation-design.md` for the full rationale.

### Declarative HTTP mocking

If `wiremock-standalone` is on your classpath, drop plain WireMock mapping JSON under
`src/test/resources/httpmocks/<service-name>/mappings/*.json` and the corresponding
`<service-name>.base-url` property is injected automatically — no annotation, no Java stub code:

```json
{
  "request": { "method": "POST", "urlPath": "/v1/charge" },
  "response": { "status": 200, "jsonBody": { "status": "SUCCESS" } }
}
```

`@MockExternalService(name = "payment-gateway", stubs = "classpath:httpmocks/payment-gateway-timeout")`
on a specific test class redirects just that class to an alternate stub folder (e.g. to simulate a
failure path), without touching the shared default. The autowired `HttpMockServers` bean always
reflects whichever server a test class's own `@MockExternalService` override (if any) actually
points at, and each WireMock server's lifetime is tied to the Spring test contexts that reference
it rather than the whole JVM — it's freed once the last referencing context closes.

By default, every immediate subfolder under the configured root is discovered and started this
way — fine as long as folder names line up with the `@Value`/`@ConfigurationProperties` prefixes
production code actually reads. Declare `flowable.test.http-mocks.services` to make that dependency
explicit instead of implicit: only the listed names are started (a declared name with no matching
`mappings` folder fails fast, before the context even starts refreshing), and any other folder on
the classpath — e.g. one that only ever exists as an `@MockExternalService(stubs = ...)` override
target — is left alone instead of also starting an unused server:

```yaml
flowable:
  test:
    http-mocks:
      services: # optional; absent = discover every subfolder (unchanged default)
        - fraud-check-service
```

See `claudedocs/http-mock-explicit-service-registry-design.md` for the full rationale.

### Process assertions / harness

`ProcessTestHarness` (autowired once a `ProcessEngine` exists) wraps the
`RuntimeService`/`TaskService`/`HistoryService` boilerplate that otherwise gets duplicated in
every Flowable test class: `completeSingleTask`, `awaitTaskForCandidateGroup`, `awaitEnded`,
`awaitCallActivityChild`, and a `ProcessInstanceAssert` (`hasEndedAt`, `isActive`,
`hasNoTaskForCandidateGroup`).

### BPMN failure diagnostics

Every `@FlowableProcessTest` failure -- whether raised by `ProcessInstanceAssert`/
`ProcessTestHarness` or by arbitrary test/delegate code -- is automatically enriched with a BPMN
diagnostics snapshot: current activity, process variables, activity trail, pending tasks, and
dead-letter job failures (the exception behind an async service task that silently got parked as a
retryable job, rather than failing the test directly). It's attached as a suppressed exception on
the original failure, so it shows up wherever the stack trace already does -- IDE, console,
Surefire reports -- with no reporting plugin to configure.

On by default; disable it, or tune its limits, via:

```yaml
flowable:
  test:
    diagnostics:
      enabled: true                      # default true
      max-activity-trail-entries: 20     # default 20
      max-variable-value-length: 500     # default 500
      include-failed-jobs: true          # default true
      max-tracked-process-instances: 50  # default 50
      redacted-variable-names:           # default: password,token,secret,apikey,authorization,ssn
        - password
        - token
```

Process variable values are otherwise dumped verbatim into text that routinely ends up archived in
CI (Surefire reports, log aggregation); any variable whose name contains one of
`redacted-variable-names` (case-insensitive substring match) is rendered as `[REDACTED]` instead.
`max-tracked-process-instances` caps how many process instances a single test failure will run full
diagnostics queries against -- a test that starts an unusually large number of instances can't turn
one failure into an unbounded diagnostics-collection cost; instances beyond the cap are simply
omitted, with a count of how many, rather than silently truncated without saying so.

A diagnostics-collection failure (a flaky DB connection at exactly the moment something has already
gone wrong is a realistic case) is logged and swallowed, never allowed to replace the real test
failure it was trying to enrich.

Not currently verified under JUnit 5 parallel test execution: the process-instance tracking this
feature relies on is a single Spring-scoped bean reset per test method, and a shared Spring context
running test methods concurrently could see one method's reset race another's in-flight failure
collection. Sequential execution (JUnit 5's default) is unaffected.

See `claudedocs/bpmn-failure-diagnostics-design.md` for the full rationale.

## Flowable version compatibility

| Starter version | Supported Flowable range |
|---|---|
| 0.1.x | `[7.0.0, 8.0.0)` |

This starter compiles against Flowable as a `provided`-scope dependency and never bundles it — the
consumer's own `org.flowable:flowable-spring-boot-starter` is always the sole source of the engine
at runtime, so there's no version conflict to worry about (Maven `provided` scope doesn't
propagate transitively). At test startup, `FlowableCompatibilityGuardAutoConfiguration` checks the
consumer's actual runtime `ProcessEngine.VERSION` against the supported range above and fails fast
with an actionable message if it's outside it, rather than surfacing as an obscure
`NoSuchMethodError` mid-test.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the full test suite once per Flowable release at the ends of
the supported range (currently `7.0.0` and `7.1.0`), so the range above is empirically verified on
every push rather than just asserted.

## Design rationale

See the design doc in the `flowable-bpmn-masterclass` reference project
(`claudedocs/flowable-test-starter-design.md`) for the full rationale behind every decision above
— module boundary, why `provided` scope specifically prevents version conflicts, why HTTP mocking
reuses WireMock's native format instead of a bespoke schema, and why the Kafka/HTTP-mock timing
requires `EnvironmentPostProcessor`/`ContextCustomizerFactory` rather than plain `@Bean` methods.

## Status

Every capability has passing validation tests, both internal (`flowable-test-autoconfigure`'s own
suite, run against a real pinned Flowable 7.1.0 engine) and end-to-end (`flowable-test-example`, a
real Spring Boot + Flowable + Kafka Event Registry order-processing app that depends on this
starter exactly like an external consumer would — see its own README for what it proves). Both
suites run on every push via CI's `mvn clean test`, across the full supported Flowable range
(7.0.0 and 7.1.0), so the starter is validated end to end without relying on any external consumer
project.
